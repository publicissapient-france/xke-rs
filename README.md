## Questions
* Difference between Rust and Go (why rust instead of go) ?
    - Rust Runtime is [lightweight](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#does-rust-have-a-runtime). Go runtime is [pretty big](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-Go-runtime-work-What-does-it-consist-of-What-functionalities-does-it-provide-and-what-can-be-expected-from-a-developer-perspective)(conccurent scheduler + GC).
    - Memory Management, GC in Go vs no GC in rust.
    - Generics in rust.
    - Strongly typed in rust.
    - Easy to learn for Go.
    - Hard to learn for rust.
    - Goal of rust: concurrent for C ([a safe, modern and fearless concurrent C](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#what-is-this-projects-goal)).
    - Goal of Go: [language with fast compilation time and easy concurrency](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article). (but but why docker has choose Go if it wasn't C concurrent ?? Because [various](https://fr.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go/18-Why_GoThe_Five_Reasons_Why) reasons but none of them is: Go is a drop in replacement to C/C++).
Conclusion they are not on the same field. Rust isn't better than Go. Go isn't better than rust.

* Why would we (xebians) learn Rust ? Why it would be nice to know rust in Xebia ?
    - Learn Rust, increase your skills in your favorite language and in your computer comprehension.
    - IOT guys, rust is for you.
    - Rust is growing, it could be the next big thing.
    - Wanna: true performance OR security OR low memory usage OR memory predictability, for a new project ? Choose rust.
